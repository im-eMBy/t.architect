## Live: [LIVE](http://t-architect.netlify.app)
Note: 
- page uses Strapi CMS hosted on Heroku - first site opening may take a while (as Heroku free dynos are probably "sleeping"),
- page is not finished yet and there will be more content added.

## General:

Minimalistic portfolio website for architect. Website fetches data from Strapi CMS. Site created on the basis of Figma mockup, made by my friend (and UI designer): [Zuza](https://www.behance.net/zuzannadesigner). CMS code is in another (private) repo.

## Stack:
Frontend: React (with react-router) + SCSS <br>
Backend: Strapi CMS deployed on Heroku + Cloudinary for media library
